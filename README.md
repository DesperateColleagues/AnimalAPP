# AnimalAPP :feet:

AnimalAPP is an application developed during one of our classes that we attended in our course of study at the University. 

AnimalAPP allows veterinarians, institutions that deal with animals, enthusiasts and owners to get in touch and create a network that allows you to carry out numerous actions.

### Pet owners & passionates :standing_person:

Pet owners can keep all the information relating to their puppies within the application; from the expenses they have incurred for them to their sensitive data, such as identification codes. It is also possible to store photos of the animals in the form of small photo-diaries. 

### Veterinarians :lab_coat:

Veterinarians can create schedules for reservations within the application, thus allowing a quick and schematic organization of appointments.
They can also store diagnoses and reports of every visit they make on the animals they care for.

### Institutions :hospital:

The institutions can manage the animals (strays and not) entrusted to them.
They, and even veterinarians, can offer temporary housing for animals owned by people.

### Findings :mag: :warning:

The "social" element within the application is also guaranteed by a special section in which each entity in the system can report any finding or loss of animals and requests/offers.



###### :exclamation: Disclaimer: in writing this code, every effort is made to follow well-defined and well-established modeling patterns. Also, the code is commented where necessary to avoid methods that are cognitively difficult to understand. We will try, as far as possible, to always improve our standards to publish code that could be also useful to other people.
